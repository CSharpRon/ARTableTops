## Description
The main goal for this project was to create our first AR experience: a table top, pong-like game, that can be played with two users on two different
phones using Augmented Reality. Since this was our first experience with AR, the latest version of our code is to demonstrate our use of models.

The current version of the app has the following features which were **not** present in the demo version of ARCore and were coded from scratch.
   
- Three open source models that were not provided by Google
- The ability to select any of the three models and place them within the sandbox area as well as resize them
- A delete function to remove the previous model that was placed
- A horizontal scroll bar to navigate between the iamges and the delete function.

## Resources
To get started with this project, we relied on the sample code provided by Google which can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart)   
Our models also came from the website [yobi3D.com](https://www.yobi3d.com/) which contains many free models. 

## Takeaway/Future Goals
We certainly learned much in this project abou the science behind Augmented Reality from a programming perspective. Through the tutorials we
 watched and followed, we learned how programmers have handled the challenges presented by AR and how we can use the platform ourselves.   
After HackGT is up, we fully intend on completing this app and creating a prototype of the Table Top game we had planned.
